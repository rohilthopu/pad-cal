# PAD DB (Web)

PAD DB is a pet project of mine to provide access to Puzzle and Dragons (PAD) data in an 
alternative source to already existing platforms. This specific repository refers to the 
desktop version and REST API. 

See the site [here](https://www.pad-db.com).

The site provides access to Guerrilla Dungeons, Monsters, and Dungeon information.

This site is meant to be a side resource to the mobile app, as the main goal is to just provide API
access to my mobile app, [PAD DB (iOS)](https://github.com/rohilthopu/pdb-swift). Having a web interface
helps me more easily visualize what the data currently looks like and helps me find errors in my code.
