# PAD DB (Web)

PAD DB is a pet project of mine to provide access to Puzzle and Dragons (PAD) data in an 
alternative source to already existing platforms. This specific repository refers to the 
REST API and Query backend system. 

See the site [here](https://www.pad-db.com).

This site is meant to be a side resource to the mobile app, as the main goal is to just provide API
access to my mobile app, [PAD DB (iOS)](https://github.com/rohilthopu/pdb-swift).
