# pad-cal
Attempting to make an open source remake of PadGuide through crowdsourcing. 

Ignore bs4-test.py for the time being. I am hoping to implement this into a Django backend.

    bs4-test.py

    An... attempt... at writing a parser for dungeon pages on padx.

    Their HTML code is terribly strange and difficult to parse efficiently.


 Current capabilities :

    1. Parse dungeon data : Titles, Stamina cost, floors, etc
