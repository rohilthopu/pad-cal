# pad-db


Pad DB is a simple project of mine to wrap the data from within Puzzles and Dragons, using raw and processed PAD data.

The app uses a set of custom Django commands to parse and load the data into Django models. 

Guerrilla dungeons and the karma leaderboards are updated regularly, with guerrillas updated every hour,
and karma every day.
